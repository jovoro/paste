Paste
=====

Simple script to act as web-based clipboard, so to speak. The idea is also simple:

$ generate_important_output.pl | curl -X POST --data @- https://paste.jovoro.ch/
abc123def

$ curl https://paste.jovoro.ch/?id=abc123def | process_important_output.pl

If you want to preserve line breaks in your text or if you are sending binary data, use the --data-binary option for curl.
